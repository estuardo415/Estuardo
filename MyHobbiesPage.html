    <p> If there is one thing you must know about me is that I 
    love soccer! <br>This is my passion and the thing I live for.
    If it wasnt for soccer life<br> would become boring and hard to live through. In addtion, I enjoy<br> breathing and medidate to myself. This helps me become much more<br> sane and helps me think about myself. My personal health and well being <br> comes before anything. <p>
